              <h6 id="split">They Split Off For 3 Reasons</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>The Chickasaw people disagreed with the Choctaw government.</li>
                <li>They wished to develop their own customs and traditions.</li>
                <li>Tensions were arising between the confliciting people.</li>
              </ul>

              <p id="early">
                The Chickasaw history began much before their split. In 1818 tribal leaders signed a treaty to give the land they had settled to Kentucky and Tennessee. It was after this that they were forced down the Trail of Tears in the mid to early 1800's and moved into Oklahoma. After many years of reestablishing government and social structure, the Chickasaw Nation finally emerged in Tishomingo in the mid 1800's. It was in this time that a new constitution was ratified
              </p>
              <p id="fall">
                Later, during the civil war, the Chickasaw people formally joined and fought for the confederacy. This decision was costly, and ultimately yielded little, and ended with a Chickasaw treaty being signed to abolish slavery as well as provide railroad right of way into their lands. This called for another, entirely new constitution, which posed even more challenge for the Chickasaw People. The Chickasaw people were ended with the tribal laws, which ended tribal sovereignty.
              </p>
              <h5>Being "Civilised"</h5>
              <p>
                The Chickasaw were considered "Civilised," meaning adopting to the rest of American culture. This is shown in their constitution, as well as some of their customs, however, they were distinctly different from other Americans. The tribe did not give up on their roots or traditions which strengthened their society.
