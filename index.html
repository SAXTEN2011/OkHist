              <h6 id="split">They Split Off For 3 Reasons</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>The Chickasaw people disagreed with the Choctaw government.</li>
                <li>They wished to develop their own customs and traditions.</li>
                <li>Tensions were arising between the confliciting people.</li>
              </ul>

              <p id="early">
                The Chickasaw history began much before their split. In 1818 tribal leaders signed a treaty to give the land they had settled to Kentucky and Tennessee. It was after this that they were forced down the Trail of Tears in the mid to early 1800's and moved into Oklahoma. After many years of reestablishing government and social structure, the Chickasaw Nation finally emerged in Tishomingo in the mid 1800's. It was in this time that a new constitution was ratified
              </p>
              <p id="fall">
                Later, during the civil war, the Chickasaw people formally joined and fought for the confederacy. This decision was costly, and ultimately yielded little, and ended with a Chickasaw treaty being signed to abolish slavery as well as provide railroad right of way into their lands. This called for another, entirely new constitution, which posed even more challenge for the Chickasaw People. The Chickasaw people were ended with the tribal laws, which ended tribal sovereignty.
              </p>
              <h5 id="civilised">Being "Civilised"</h5>
              <p>
                The Chickasaw were considered "Civilised," meaning adopting to the rest of American culture. This is shown in their constitution, as well as some of their customs, however, they were distinctly different from other Americans. The tribe did not give up on their roots or traditions which strengthened their society.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among their customs were their semi-nomadic nature. They would move locations depending on season, and available game at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Chickasaw were not only matrilineal, but gave women higher roles in society, which was incredibly different from the traditional "Civilised" expectations.
              </p>

              <h5 id="traditions">Traditions</h5>
              <p>Stories were massive in Chickasaw culture. Stories were passed down to every generation, and were incredibly important in teaching and keeping culture of the tribe.</p>
                <h6 id="religion">Religion</h6>
                <p>The Chickasaw, like many tribes are polytheistic. Their gods are based on forces of nature like the sun.</p>

                <h6 id="food">Food</h6>
                <p>The 3 Sisters, as they are called, are Beans Squash And Corn. These 3 Sisters are the most important and most common foods to find in a Chickasaw village.</p>

                <h6 id="tools">Tools and Weapons</h6>
                <p>Ceramics were the new hit for the Chickasaw. Clay was still used, but ceramics were a status symbol, and highly decorated ceramics showed even more wealth.</p>
                <p>Bows and Arrows were frequent hunting tools, the men in the village were masters of the bow and were unparalleled hunters.</p>
                <p>Proper axes were found in Chickasaw villages, used for farming and woodcutting, these stone axes were cornerstones of the developed Chickasaw.</p>

                <h6 id="language">Language</h6>
                <p>The Chickasaw spoke their own language that was created as a mongrel language between the Muskogee and other languages, such as the Choctaw.</p>
                <h6 id="clothing">Clothing</h6>
                <p>Because of their excellent male hunters, deerskin and other pelts were frequently used to create clothing.</p>
                <p>Shaving was also surprisingly common in Chickasaw culture. Shaving is usually not found in such a hunting dominant culture.</p>

                <h6 id="government">Government</h6>
                <p>The Chickasaw had a very democratic government. More localised councils would report to the Minko, or high chief, to make decisions.</p>
